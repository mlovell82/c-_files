# c-_files
a collection of my c# files

the ones with names starting with "goldilocks" were created for a unity game I created.  It was based on the story "Goldilocks and the 3 
Bears.  these c# files are used to control interactions between game objects in the game.

the files with names starting with "pacman" were created for a unity version of pacman I created.  these c# files are used to control interactions between game objects in the game

the files with names starting with "sample" are common programming constructs that I learned watching you tub tutorials, then creating similar files for practice
